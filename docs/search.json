Sprint demos should (where in this case the stakeholder is just Prof. Kim):\n\ndemonstrate the current working behavior of any data science products\narticulate to stakeholders what was accomplished and what was not during the sprint\nreceive feedback from stakeholders\nsuggest a path forward during the next sprint\n\nFormat:\n\nNo required format, just whatever you think is best for communication. Previously, some groups were able to just show and narrate when they had in RStudio or a Jupyter Notebook, others made slides that weren’t perfectly polished.\nEach group has limited time so use your time wisely.\n\n\n\n\nSprint retrospectives x3\nSprint retrospectives provide a mechanism for continually improving the working relationship among your team. Themes to be discussed include, but are not limited to:\n\nWhat went well in the sprint? (“I like…”)\nWhat didn’t go well in the sprint (“I don’t like…”)\nWhat could be improved? (“I wish…”)\nWhat will we commit to improve in the next Sprint? (“What if…”)\nHow can Albert and Megan help you?\n\nAfter your retrospective session with Megan Lyster, you will return to your Group Norms Google Doc, go to the appropriate sprint number section, and write a retrospective based on the prompts given in the agenda above.\n\n\n\nProject presentations\nAt the end of the semester A presentation will be given by students to all sponsors, stakeholders, and the professor."

Often, this section will conclude with a subsection (or paragraph) outlining “our contributions.” What is the new knowledge that this paper contributes?\nData: Where did it come from? What are some basic summary statistics, variable definitions, and/or visualizations that help the reader understand the data you are working with?\nMethods: What did you actually do? What techniques or methods did you employ? What were the specifications for any statistical models you used? What software or packages did you use or develop?\nResults: What did you learn about the problem you identified in Section 1? This is where you put the tables, figures, and analytics by-products of your work.\nConclusion: What are the limitations of your work? What are some next steps that someone (either you or another research group) should consider in attempting to further your work? Remind us one last time about what you did.\n\n\nReferences: Every reference (except for books) needs a URL. Use Zotero and Google Scholar to help with BibTeX. Every book needs publisher location.\n\nOptionally, if you have more stuff:\n\nAppendix: Include supplementary graphs and tables in an appendix. The reader may or may not read the appendix."

Please read carefully – these are mandatory recommendations.\nGeneral feedback:\n\nUse an academic writing style. Use the present tense (in almost every case), even when writing about previously published papers or work that you did two months ago. Use “we” to describe your efforts. Avoid the passive voice!\nUse examples, screenshots, or peeks at data to illustrate what you are talking about.\nDon’t be afraid to get technical – this is a scientific paper. However, if you are going to invoke technical terms or concepts, you have to either explain them or give a citation to a reference that does.\nFocus on problems and solutions. What were the problems that your client had? How did you solve them? Don’t just narrate about what you did – connect the work that you did to the problems that existed before you started. If you find this hard to do, perhaps what you are writing about doesn’t need to be in the paper.\nRevise, then revise again."

For some projects, this statement could be quite short (one paragraph may suffice). For other projects, more detail may be needed (no more than 2 pages).\nBe expansive and creative in your thinking about possible ethical considerations. One way to do this assignment poorly would be to write a short statement asserting that there are no ethical considerations, only to have me think of several fairly obvious ones."

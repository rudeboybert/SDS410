    "text": "Please follow the following guidelines for all phases of your final paper:\n\nAll papers will be written in R Markdown using the term_paper.Rmd file. Knit early, knit often.\nUse BibTeX for citations. Use Google Scholar to gather reference information in BibTeX format (adjust manually where necessary). Include doi and/or url field in BibTeX entries. Insert citations into the body of the paper as appropriate in R Markdown. Cite R packages with information from citation(). You can start a .bib file with knitr::write_bib(). The `BibTeX database for this page looks like this.\nInclude link to GitHub repository (where necessary) as a citation (even if it’s private)!\nFigures should be in a figure environment (in LaTeX). If the figure is generated as a plot in R, name the chunk and use the fig.cap chunk option. If the figure is an external image, use knitr::include_graphics(). All Figures must be referenced explicitly in the text by number. Figures should have expansive captions that tell the reader what they are supposed to see in the figure. All figures should have readable axis labels and explicit units. Figures should be mostly self-explanatory! Spend more time gussying up the figures – not less! Recall the SDS 192 standards for Aesthetics, Context, and Markdown.\nTables should be in a table environment (in LaTeX). If the table is generated from data in R, use the kable() function. If the table is input manually, just put it in a data.frame and use kable() anyway. Tables should also have expansive captions and must be referenced in the text by number. Simple summary tables are easy to generate and really helpful to readers!\nUse Markdown formatting, including: sections and subsections, lists, links, block quotes, chunks, and code, where appropriate.\nPut any pieces of code in backticks (`). That includes names of packages, functions, variable names, and even certain strings. For bits of actual code, use a chunk. Note that R Markdown supports chunks in many languages, including Python, SQL, and bash.\nUse wordcountaddin::text_stats() to count your words.\n\n\nwordcountaddin::text_stats()"

Why is this problem interesting? What has been tried before? What have been the shortcoming of those approaches that necessitate your efforts? Often, this section will conclude with a subsection (or paragraph) outlining “our contributions.” What is the new knowledge that this paper contributes?\nData: Where did it come from? What are some basic summary statistics, variable definitions, and/or visualizations that help the reader understand the data you are working with?\nMethods: What did you actually do? What techniques or methods did you employ? What were the specifications for any statistical models you used? What software or packages did you use or develop?\nResults: What did you learn about the problem you identified in Section 1? This is where you put the tables, figures, and analytics by-products of your work.\nConclusion: What are the limitations of your work? What are some next steps that someone (either you or another research group) should consider in attempting to further your work? Remind us one last time about what you did.\nReferences: Every reference (except for books) needs a URL. Use Zotero and Google Scholar to help with BibTeX. Every book needs publisher location.\n(Optional) Appendix: Include supplementary graphs and tables in an appendix. The reader may or may not read the appendix."

For some projects, this statement could be quite short (one paragraph may suffice). For other projects, more detail may be needed (no more than 2 pages).\nBe expansive and creative in your thinking about possible ethical considerations.
